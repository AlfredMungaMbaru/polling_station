### 🗄️ **Database Schema (Supabase Ready)**

```sql
-- Comments table
CREATE TABLE poll_comments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  poll_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES polls(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_id UUID REFERENCES poll_comments(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  content TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (char_length(content) > 0 AND char_length(content) <= 1000),
  is_moderated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  is_deleted BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_poll_comments_poll_id ON poll_comments(poll_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_poll_comments_user_id ON poll_comments(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_poll_comments_parent_id ON poll_comments(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_poll_comments_created_at ON poll_comments(created_at);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE poll_comments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Comments are viewable by everyone" ON poll_comments
  FOR SELECT USING (is_moderated = true AND is_deleted = false);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own comments" ON poll_comments
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own comments" ON poll_comments
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id) 
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
